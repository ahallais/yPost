## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Access to a Usenet provider/NNTP server
- PAR2 command-line tool (for PAR2 recovery file generation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahallais/yPost.git
cd yPost
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o ypost
```

### Configuration

1. Initialize configuration:
```bash
./ypost config init
```

2. Edit the generated `config.yaml` file with your NNTP server details:
```yaml
nntp:
  server: "your-newsserver.com"
  port: 563
  username: "your-username"
  password: "your-password"
  ssl: true
  connections: 8

posting:
  newsgroup: "alt.binaries.test"
  from: "poster@example.com"
  subject_template: "[{{.Index}}/{{.Total}}] - {{.Filename}} - ({{.Size}})"

splitting:
  max_file_size: "50MB"
  max_lines: 5000

par2:
  redundancy: 10
  enabled: true

sfv:
  enabled: true

logging:
  level: "info"
  file: "ypost.log"
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic File Posting

Post a single file:
```bash
./ypost post /path/to/your/file.iso
```

Post multiple files:
```bash
./ypost post /path/to/file1.zip /path/to/file2.rar
```

Post with custom options:
```bash
./ypost post --newsgroup "alt.binaries.multimedia" --subject "My Custom Subject" /path/to/file.mkv
```

### Configuration Management

View current configuration:
```bash
./ypost config show
```

Update configuration values:
```bash
./ypost config set nntp.connections 12
./ypost config set posting.newsgroup "alt.binaries.movies"
```

### Advanced Options

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
./ypost post --verbose /path/to/file.iso
```

Dry run (test without posting):
```bash
./ypost post --dry-run /path/to/file.iso
```

Custom output directory:
```bash
./ypost post --output-dir /path/to/output /path/to/file.iso
```

- `server`: NNTP server hostname
- `port`: Server port (typically 119 for plain, 563 for SSL)
- `username`/`password`: Authentication credentials
- `ssl`: Enable SSL/TLS connection
- `connections`: Number of concurrent connections

### Posting Settings
